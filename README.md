# Chrono Warp: Time Dilation Visualization

## A space exploration project

## Introduction

**Chrono Warp** is an educational project inspired by Christopher Nolan’s *Interstellar*. It models and visualizes **time dilation**—a phenomenon from Einstein’s theory of relativity. Using synthetic data from NASA APIs and custom scenarios, the project demonstrates how time slows down with increasing velocity and gravity.

## Features

- **Analytical Modeling**: Predicts time dilation based on velocity and gravity.
- **Visualizations**: Shows time dilation effects through interactive plots.
- **Extreme Scenarios**: Simulates time dilation near black holes and at high speeds.


## Usage

- Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the model and visualizations.
- Adjust parameters to simulate different time dilation scenarios.

## Visualizations

Examples include:
- **Velocity vs. Time Dilation**
- **Gravity vs. Time Dilation**
- **Extreme Dilation Near a Black Hole**


## Inspiration

Inspired by *Interstellar*, this project explores the science of time dilation, making complex concepts accessible through visualizations.
